This directory conatins two conversion scripts written in Python.

The first one (convert.py) is a modified version of the conversion script found here: https://github.com/Guanghan/darknet/blob/master/scripts/convert.py
  It has been modified for more automatic conversion with many classes, and has the drone classes built into it.

The other script (convertTSV.py) is the same as the first one, but it converts text files that have tabs between coordinates instead of spaces.
