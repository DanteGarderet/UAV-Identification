Detection of unmanned ariel vehicles using YOLO real-time object detection.

Contains datasets of eight classes of drones (Civilian drones– DJI Phantom, DJI Mavic, Yuneec Tyhphoon, Parrot Bebop    Military drones– RQ-11 Raven, MQ-9 Reaper/Predator, RQ-7 Shadow, RQ-4 Global Hawk) and annotation text files in YOLO format

Also contains scripts to convert annotation files into YOLO format.

The datasets contain about 400 images per class, so they are a good starting point for you to add your own data too. If you want to have extremley accurate drone detection, these datasets cannot do it by themselves
